Nand2Tetris — Part 1: From NAND to a Functional Computer

This repository contains my solutions and notes for Nand2Tetris Part 1: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles.
The course, offered by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, focuses on constructing a complete computer system from the ground up—starting with basic logic gates and culminating in a functional machine capable of running programs.

Course Overview

Nand2Tetris Part 1 emphasizes the hardware side of computer construction.
By the end of the course, you will have built a complete Hack Computer, capable of executing programs written in the Hack assembly language.

Projects and Exercises
Week	Project	Description
01	Boolean Logic	Build basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) using only NAND gates.
02	Boolean Arithmetic	Implement adders, incrementers, and ALU components for arithmetic operations.
03	Sequential Logic	Design flip-flops, registers, and memory units using DFFs.
04	Machine Language	Learn the Hack assembly language and implement computational operations.
05	CPU Design	Build the Hack CPU using previously designed components and ALU.
06	Memory and CPU Integration	Integrate memory with the CPU to execute simple programs.
